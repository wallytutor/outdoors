A few weeks back I randomly proposed at my club's Whatsapp group to make a quite different mountain activity from what the folks are used to: leave in Mountain Biking, take a break to follow a Via Ferrata, and then back on the road.

As usual, the key point of the trip is that we were not using any personal vehicles; the goal was to use only public transportation to reach the Chartreuse massif and back. I was lucky and got a few answers and finally we organized everything to leave early the next morning. This sort of trip needs to be tough of as a last minute deal because weather may change and doing the mix MTB-Ferrata can become impossible. We took one of the first trains in the morning from Lyon to Chamb√©ry, where our adventure started.
