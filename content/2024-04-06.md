A few weeks back I randomly wrote to my club's Whatsapp group to propose a quite unusual mountain activity (at least to the majority point of view): leave in mountain biking, take a break to follow a via ferrata, and then get back on the road. I really don't get it why people sometimes wanna be *monosport*... there is so much you can do by maximizing the possibilities over a day of adventure. As usual, the key point of the trip is that we were not using any personal vehicles; the goal was to use only public transportation to reach the Chartreuse massif and back. 

I was lucky and got a few answers and finally we organized everything to leave early the next morning. This sort of trip needs to be tough of as a last minute deal because weather may change and doing the mix biking-ferrata can easily become impossible. You cannot simply engage in a ferrata without the certainty of a sunny day or no thunderstorms approaching.

### How did it go?

We took one of the first trains in the morning from Lyon to Chamb√©ry, where our adventure started.
